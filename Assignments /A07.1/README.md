# Web Scraping

this project create a Python program that scrapes weather data from a website and displays it using the PySimpleGUI library. The program will allow users to specify the date and location for which they want to retrieve the weather data.

## Full Description

1. used web scraping techniques to extract weather data from a website. The BeautifulSoup library is used to parse the HTML content, and the Selenium library is used to interact with the website and retrieve dynamic content if necessary.

2. The program will prompt the user to enter the date and location for which they want to retrieve the weather data. We created a GUI using PySimpleGUI to make it user-friendly. The GUI will include input fields for the date and a drop-down menu to select the location.

3. Once the user submits the form, the program will construct the URL with the provided date and location. This URL will be used to retrieve the weather data from the website.

4. The program will perform web scraping on the website, extracting the desired weather information such as high temperature, low temperature, average temperature, and precipitation etc.

5. The scraped weather data will be formatted and displayed in a table using PySimpleGUI.
